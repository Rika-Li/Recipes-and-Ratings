# Recipes-and-Ratings
by Kening Li
## Introduction
Welcome to our culinary exploration, where data meets deliciousness! Our dataset is a flavorful blend of recipes and user interactions that offer a window into the world of home cooking. It consists of two main parts:

1. **Recipes**: A collection of culinary creations, detailing the ingredients and steps needed to prepare each dish.

2. **Interactions**: A record of user engagements with the recipes, including ratings and reviews that reflect personal experiences and satisfaction

The central question of our project is **"What factors contribute to a recipe's popularity?"** This query is essential because understanding these factors can empower anyone to create recipes that resonate with a wider audience and elevate the cooking experience.:monocle_face:
